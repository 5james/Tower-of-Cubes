This project is about creating the highest possible tower of cubes. Here are some rules about cubes and how the tower should look like:

- Each Cube's faces are varicoloured (This means that number of colours avaible are minimum 6)
- Each Cube has specified weight
- If you want to put cube A on top of cube B -> cube B must be heavier or the same weight as cube A AND colour of top of cube B must be the same as colout of bottom of cube A

The idea to solve this problem will be in documentation.
